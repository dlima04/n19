# n19 Reference Language

This directory contains the implementation of a reference language frontend - aptly named "rl",
which utilizes n19 as part of its backend. rl is quite rudimentary, and only has support for
basic language constructs (variables, functions, control flow, etc).

rl mainly exists as a "playground" of sorts - that is: to help showcase and demonstrate the various
features of the project in an intuitive manner.
